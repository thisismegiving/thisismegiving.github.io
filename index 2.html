                        <P>Packing his camera equipment and other necessities, Stephen Wong does not have many memories to take with him when he leaves Hong Kong. 
                        He is planning a small farewell dinner with his working partners and close friends. Mr. Wong is a freelance wedding photographer. He also worked part-time at the office of a District councilor in Kwun Tong for a year.  
                        <br><br>
                        <div style="width:1366; height: 700px; font-size: small; text-align: center;"> 
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/portfolio/S02.JPG" alt=""/>
                            Stephen Wong collecting public opinion at Kwun Tong
                        </div>
                        Mr. Wong hoped  to resettle in the United Kingdom by the end of this year, leaving behind his parents and younger sister.  He is worried that people in Hong Kong will lose the freedom of speech and access to fair trials. 
                        He saw a photo of Jimmy Lai in handcuffs and chains. Lai is the proprietor of the Apple Daily newspaper and  is one of nearly 100 people arrested for possible violation of the national security law.  
                       <br><br>
                       The national security law was gazetted on Jun. 30, 2020 and took immediate effect. It is supposed to “prevent, suppress and impose punishment for the offences of secession, 
                       subversion, organisation and perpetration of terrorist activities''. Those who “collude with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security” risk being arrested. 
                       The maximum penalty is life in prison.
                       <br><br>
                       The law is worrying for people who are politically active or are critical of the government.
                       <br><br>
                       “ Even organising election activities within the pro-democracy camp may be a violation. There is not much we can do now in Hong Kong, so moving to another country would be a possible way for us to continue to voice our opinion 
                       toward human rights and justice in Hong Kong,” Mr Wong said.
                       <br><br>
                       In 2019, Mr Wong joined a peaceful anti-government protest. He also helped organise the district council election. He has never been a high profile person. Back then he wasn’t scared of being targeted. Since then, things have changed. Chanting the slogans of the 2019 movement may be deemed seditious. He’s read about how 12 young people who tried to leave for Taiwan ended up being caught by mainland authorities. 
                       They were jailed for a few months and returned to Hong Kong to face further charges. Mr Wong is frightened.
                        <br><br>
                        Stephen Wong’s parents didn’t know that he was planning to move to the UK. He rarely had a discussion related to the current politics in the city with his parents in order to avoid family’s dispute. 
                        <br><br>
                        “My parents have an emotional attachment to their home in the mainland. They always think that the government should control the society in order to maintain a stable situation. So, we should not complain too much about it and let the government run the society. 
                        They consider themself as patriotic Chinese” said Mr Wong.
                        <br><br>
                        Willis Fu Yiu-wai, Marketing Director and Senior Immigration Consultant of Goldmax Associates said that more and more young middle class Hong Kong residents are seeking immigration consultation at his company.  Since 2019, there has been a four to five-fold increase. He said that political instability and the wishes of parents for their children to have a western education are some of the factors. Promulgation of the national security law, he added, is also making Hong Kong residents feel insecure about the city's autonomy. 
                        “The United Kingdom, Canada, United States and Australia are the most popular countries for those who want to leave because of their education systems and high standard of living”, he added.

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">BNO Passport</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="text-lg-left">
                    <p> Following the introduction of the national security legislation in Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hong-kong-bno-visa-policy-statement/hong-kong-british-national-overseas-visa-policy-statement-plain-text-version">the UK</a> announced that from January 2021, all British National Overseas passport holders and their dependents will be given the right to work and study for five years in the UK, 
                        and they will be able to apply for citizenship after a further year. 
                        <br><br>
                        After the enactment of Hong Kong Act 1985, the British National Overseas passport was created in 1987. Those who hold BNO passports are permanent residents of Hong Kong 
                        who were British Dependent Territories citizens until 30 June 1997 and had registered as BNO.
                        <br><br>
                        The BNO passport is a travel document that does not carry citizenship rights, but holders are entitled to some consular assistance outside Hong Kong and China. It was created for people from Hong Kong so that they could retain British nationality and connection to the UK 
                        after the handover to China in 1997 in line with the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
                        <br><br>
                        Previously, these passport holders had the right to remain in the UK for up to six months, but they were not allowed to reside or work there. 
                        They are not allowed to access public funds, such as government benefits.
                        <br><br>
                        Mr Wong holds a British National (Overseas) passport which means he is now eligible to stay in Britain for five years and apply for settlement 
                        if he meets <a href="https://www.gov.uk/british-national-overseas-bno-visa/living-permanently-in-the-uk">the knowledge of English requirements and passes the “Life in the UK” Test.</a>
                        <br><br>
                        He has been trying to learn about life in the UK by watching videos shared by a youtuber, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_vZsUCJrwYrbIRPHacAS_Q">Cocogor </a> recently moved to the UK from Hong Kong. 
                        Mr Wong says many of his friends are also planning to move there. 
                        <br><br>
                        He believes that the UK shares a similar culture and political system to Hong Kong since the city was once colonised by the British. 
                        He is optimistic about his relocation and hopes to continue to pursue his photography career in the UK. 
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukia/2020/70/pdfs/ukia_20200070_en.pdf">A study by the British Home Office</a> estimates that 5.4 million Hong Kongners are eligible for the British Nationality (Overseas) passport 
                        and that as many as 322,000 will move to the country between 2021 and 2025.
                        <br><br>
                        But Beijing sees Britain's new citizenship pathway as a violation of <a href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt9j3546s0/qt9j3546s0.pdf?t=n4ov53>">the handover agreement</a> which stipulates that BNO passport holders do not enjoy UK residency. 
                        China has repeatedly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwE6UY9gA78&ab_channel=CCTVVideoNewsAgency">warned Britain</a> to stay out of its affairs in Hong Kong.
                        <br><br>
                        Officials from Hong Kong told 14 countries to stop accepting applications from Hong Kongers under the holiday working visa scheme and those applicants should instead present their Hong Kong passport. The working holiday scheme allows 
                        Hong Kongers aged between 18 and 30 who wish to seek cultural and educational exchange in countries signatory to the scheme.
                        <br><br>
                        A housewife with two children Ms Chan, 38, who asked to be identified only by her surname and her husband are BNO passport holders. She is worried about her relocation plan as the Hong Kong government attempted to propose <a href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/2020/12/04/supp3/1!en">the amendments of immigration ordinance</a> that would authorise immigration to ban anyone from boarding a plane or a ship without obtaining a court order. 
                        So she is in a hurry to leave because she is worried she might lose her opportunity to do so.
                        <br><br>
                        “In the past few months, the BNO passport has been a very sensitive issue for the HKSAR government and Chinese government. I think they will try all they can to make you stay. 
                        I don’t think they will let you go easily,” Ms Chan said. 
                        <br><br>
                        The <a href="https://www.hkba.org/sites/default/files/Immigration%20%28Amendment%29%20Bill%202020%20-%20Clause%203%20-%20Further%20Submission%2011.2.2021.pdf">Hong Kong Bar association</a> criticised the proposed amendment bill, saying the amendment could give “apparently unfettered power” to the immigration director.
                        <br><br>
                        In a statement <a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202102/13/P2021021300565.htm">released</a> on Feb.13 from Security Bureau said “the proposed provision in the Immigration (Amendment) Bill 2020 (the Bill) to empower the Secretary for Security to make regulations in relation to the 
                        provision of passenger information by carriers is intended for fulfilling the international obligation of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under the "Convention on International Civil Aviation".”
                        <br><br>
                        According to <a href="https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_3.html"> Article 31 of the Basic Law</a> and <a href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap383">Article 8(2) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights</a>, “Hong Kong residents shall have freedom of movement within the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and freedom of emigration to other countries and regions. They shall have freedom to travel and to enter or leave the Region. Unless restrained by law, 
                        holders of valid travel documents shall be free to leave the Region without special authorization.”
                        <br><br>
                        On Jan. 29, the <a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202101/29/P2021012900763.htm">Hong Kong government announced</a> that it no longer recognized the British National (Overseas) passports as a valid travel document and proof of identity after the British 
                        government set out details of the application process for new BNO visas.
                        <br><br>
                        The statement said “when passengers board flights for Hong Kong, airlines must require Hong Kong residents 
                        concerned to present their HKSAR passports or Hong Kong permanent identity cards as proof.” 
                        <br><br>
                        According to the National People’s Congress Standing Committee’s explanation in 1996 about the application of Chinese Nationality Law in the SAR after the 1997 handover, Hongkongers with dual nationalities are 
                        regarded as Chinese nationals in Hong Kong.
                        <br><br>
                        Ms Chan was aware that she would be regarded as Chinese national by the authorities though she also holds a BNO passport. But she would not be threatened from the policy and pointed out that the visa was issued digitally by Britain. She could simply use her Hong Kong identity cards 
                        or Special Administrative Region passports to fly out of the city. 
                        <br><br>
                        Mr Wong thinks that it is meaningless to be a Hongkonger because his vote would not be counted toward a candidate he voted for 
                        and at the end the central government would appoint the Chief executive of Hong Kong.
                        <br><br>
                        “ I totally lost my confidence in the Hong Kong judiciary and they won’t treat me fairly. I believe that the British nationality 
                        will give me better protection because of my political background and the work I do.” Mr Wong said.
                        <br><br>
                        In Hong Kong, young people 18-29 years of age consider their identity as “Hong Konger” compared to their cohort parents. A survey by the <a href="https://www.hkupop.hku.hk/english/release/release1594.html"> University of Hong Kong</a> in 2019 found that 84.6% of 692 respondents identify themself as “Hong Konger” while 55.2% of respondents would indicate their identity as ‘Chinese’. The younger respondents, above 90% also feel less proud of becoming a national citizen of China 
                        and more than 71% negative appraisal toward the central government policy on Hong Kong.

                        Professor from City University of Hong Kong, who asked to remain anonymous, said young people have a strong identity of Hong konger because they were born and raised in the city and it is natural that they would have a strong feeling of belonging to Hong Kong. 
                        <br><br>
                        A policy paper by the <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/cshk/files/PolicyPapers/CSHK%20Policy%20Paper%204-HK%20Identity-Eng.pdf">Research Center for Sustainable Hong Kong</a> finds that trust in the central government is a highly significant factor to explain national identity strength.
                        <br><br>
                        The paper concludes “Chinese and Hong Kong identities should be understood and measured as two related, but clearly distinct attitudes. The identity strength of “Hong Konger” has essentially remained stable and unpolitical. 
                        It is the sense of belonging to China that has become weaker and increasingly partisan.”
                        <br><br>
                        Ms Chan loves Chinese culture but would consider herself as a chinese from Hong Kong, it is because she doesn’t want to have any linkage with the Chinese Communist Party.

                        “I came from Hong Kong and I am Hongkonger, that’s a choice I made to put on. I am ethnically from the Han Chinese race, that's something that I can’t change. It’s not a problem for me to say that I am chinese, it’s my root, my heritage and it’s where I came from, I don’t deny it. But predominantly I am from Hong Kong because it is so different from mainland China, I think we have to assert that differently.”Ms Chan said. 
                        <br><br>
                        Mr Wong also said he would define his identity based on values and culture. It is more suitable for him to consider himself as Hong Konger because he has participated in the movement and was moved by the spirit. 
                        <br><br>
                        “Our values and spirit are based on democratic values, and freedom of speech which I think is essential for advance civilisation.” Mr Wong said.

                    <p> A public opinion survey on emigration conducted by <a href="https://www.cpr.cuhk.edu.hk/en/press/survey-findings-on-views-about-emigration-from-hong-kong-released-by-the-hong-kong-institute-of-asia-pacific-studies-at-cuhk/">Chinese University of Hong Kong</a> in 2020 found that 43.9% of 737 respondents said they would emigrate if they had a chance and 35.0% were already preparing to move. 
                        <br><br>
                        Among them, Ms Chan and her husband are planning to leave Hong Kong in June for her children’s future. She doesn’t want her children to grow up in a place where freedom is restricted.

                        “The Education Bureau has introduced a new syllabus and guidelines. Every subject has to include some idea about the national security law. I think the purpose of this is to brainwash every student to accept whatever the mainland government wants. It is not education at all, ” Ms Chan said. 
                        <br><br>
                        “We parents have no say on what is taught in the schools. Kids are just like blank slates. You can write anything on that, so they will accept anything they are taught.  They are so young and cannot tell what is right and wrong,” Ms Chan said.
                        <br><br>
                        Ms Cheung, a primary teacher, who asked to use only her surname understands the parents’ concern. But she also thinks that learning the history of a country and its national security law is normal in other countries too. She has been teaching English, Science and moral education at a primary school for two years. 
                        <br><br>
                        She would have to follow the government’s instructions in teaching students about the history of China and politics, and would not add more information in order to protect her students and herself.
                        “I think my approach now is not to talk a lot about the political stuff to protect my students, as well as to protect myself because things are changing rapidly,” said Ms Cheung.

                        On February 4, the Education Bureau issued guidelines to bring Hong Kong’s schools in line with the national security law. The guideline states that “as far as national security is concerned, there is no room for debate or compromise”. Teachers are barred from approaching national security as a debatable matter and are expected to teach students that safeguarding national security is the responsibility of all citizens. 
                        <br><br>
                        Some critics see the prescriptive guidelines as “white terror” and invasive micromanagement of schooling, while proponents said they provided clearer guidance for educators. 
                        <br><br>
                        Hui Hon-wing, a lecturer at the Department of Education Policy and Leadership at the Education University of Hong Kong said such interference in school management is not anything new. The Education Bureau has the authority to intervene in school management when necessary in order to ensure that schools comply with the guidelines. 
                        “ I think we have experienced another kind of education practice in Hong Kong. In the past we enjoyed some sort of autonomy. For example, in liberal studies classes, teachers could discuss any topics and teach the students to have their own judgement followed with different kinds of evidence. Now under the national security law and basic law education, teachers have to follow strict instructions from the Education Bureau,”  Mr Hui said. 
                        <br><br>
                        “ I think the Education Bureau will give some materials to the schools and the officials will need the school to give them reports or responses whether they use materials provided by them.” he added.
                        <br><br>
                        An associate professor at the Department of Educational Administration and Policy, Celeste Yuen Yuet-mui, from Chinese University of Hong Kong said in principle, all schools should be in line with the government guidelines. Schools receiving government subsidies have an obligation to follow the rules and regulations.  
                        <br><br>
                        “The point is the details of the national security law. Since this is only the initial stage, a lot of details are not yet clear. This creates a lot of  fear and the uncertainties because people do not know to what extent it will allow them to do their school based management.” Prof Yuen said. 
                        <br><br>
                        “It is too early to know the impact on education as such. We have to wait and see to what extent the practical implementation of the law has on the school curriculum,” said prof. Yuen. 
                        <br><br>
                        Hong Kong has been governed by a school based management approach. Schools have their autonomy to create their own culture and structure to some extent. But now it seems that under the national security law, there are new sets of regulations, and a new set of expectations, she added. 
                        <br><br>
                        “I think there are some additional requirements for the school managers and leaders to follow.  Now they have a set of national security laws, to some extent the existing school managers, they have to be trained, they have to put into some kind of refreshment course so that they know how they should govern, manage and lead school according to the expectation of Hong Kong. I think that the Education Bureau is trying out things, they can not tell you clearly what you can do or what you can’t do,” Prof. Yuen said. 
                        <br><br>
                        Ms Chan's parents didn’t join her because of language barriers. She was sad to leave them behind. 
                        <br><br>
                        “ I pray that the situation in Hong Kong will not get worse so that we can have the chance to visit them regularly.” Ms Chan said. “We may have no chance to return to Hong Kong if the situation is getting worse.”

                    <P> While some people plan to leave, there are those who want to return to their homes in Hong Kong. Angus Liu has been teaching mathematics at United World College - Robert Bosch College in Germany since 2015. He believes that being creative in teaching under the restriction would protect teachers from being grounded by the law. 
                        <br><br>
                        “In the classroom, it might depend on the culture of the school on how much we could push or  say things without actually saying it. Maybe we have to invent creative codes to communicate things so that people understand what we’re coming from, also that will give us the protection that we need,” Mr Liu said.  
                        <br><br>
                        In 2009, Mr Liu left Hong Kong for education and completed his undergraduate degree in London. His parents now live in London. But he is planning to come back because he considers Hong Kong his home. 
                        <br><br>
                        “ I am excited to contribute back to the local education system where I grew up. I thought that would be a good reason to go back,” Mr Liu said. “I think it’s time to go back and find out what home is like and to really get a sense of what it really means to be somebody who comes from the city, ” he added.
                        <br><br>

                        But Mr Hui thinks that within this restriction, under the national security law teachers won’t have choices. 
                        <br><br>
                        “The new law endangers our professions because if you have negative comments on the ruling party especially communist party, they will say you have the intention to overthrow the country because “Love the country” and “Love the party” is the same thing. So it is very dangerous in Hong Kong especially for the teachers. 
                        I don’t think they will have many choices when the Education Bureau issues some instructions or even some teaching materials to teachers in Hong Kong.” Mr Hui said.

                            Amid the emigration trend, Ms Cheung, a primary teacher, chose not to leave Hong Kong. She said that she might not be able to pursue a teaching career as an English teacher when moving to another country. 
                            <br><br>
                            Though she was concerned about the current political situation in Hong Kong, she thinks that being cautious on what to say might keep her safe from being targeted by the authorities.  
                            <br><br>
                            “As long as I am cautious about what I say and I don’t speak a lot of political stuff in front of my students and put everything back into the books, that would be okay” Ms Cheung said. 
                            <br>
                           
                            <br>
                            Even if there is a chance for her to resettle to other countries she would choose to stay in Hong Kong because she has a stable job and she is a family oriented person. 
                            <br><br>
                            “ If my parents are still staying in Hong Kong, I would most likely stay in Hong Kong. There is a lot of work to do to maintain a relationship with your parents when you are at a different place.” said Ms Cheung.
                            In addition to the United Kingdom, Hong Kongers’ other preferred destinations are Canada and Australia, both of which eased visa restrictions in the wake of security law, according to immigratin agents and relocation firms. 
                            Canada’s immigration authorities said visa applications from Hong Kongers jumped more than 10% last year to 8,640. More than 2,500 Hong Kong passport holders in Australia have had their visa extended after Canberra unveiled new rules providing a path to Australian citizenship for people from Hong Kong in July.

                        <P> Last year November, 15 Hong Kong opposition lawmakers resigned from the Legislative Council of Hong Kong to protest against Beijing’s disqualification of four opposition members. The four members were barred from running in September’s LegCo election, which is now postponed for a year. The legislative election was postponed by the city’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam, citing the public health risk during Covid-19 pandemic. 
                            <br><br>
                            This year, Feb. 28, 53 opposition activists were charged with subversion -- holding unofficial primary election last July to determine the best candidate to win a majority in the legislature and alleged to be a part to paralyse the government. Those are prominent opposition lawmakers, district councilors and activists. 
                            <br><br>
                            As of March 2021, around 10,320 were arrested for protest related offences and 2,573 were prosecuted since 2019. Under National Security Law, displaying flags or banners, chanting slogans and conducting oneself with an intent such as subversion and succession may constitute offence. 
                            <br><br>
                            Mr Liu thinks that life in Hong Kong might be different when he returns from Germany. People might not be able to say as much as they want and be more wary of the police and their presence when they talk about sensitive issues. 
                            <br><br>
                            “We might have to be careful where and how loud we talk and what kind of setting. I guess you probably have to be more careful and know your rights and know your law a bit more. Maybe you will have more hidden conversations about politics where it is unlike before,” said Mr Liu.

                            Ms Cheung thinks that everything would be more restrictive than now but this would not affect her since she was not very politically involved in the society. 
                            <br><br>
                            “I will just perform my job and I will just go back to my family, nothing much would affect me.” Ms Cheung said. 
                            <br><br>
                            The anti-extriditional bill protest in 2019 has affected Ms Cheung’s teaching approach and enabled her to reflect on how to teach the students when the students raised questions about the movement and who is right and wrong. 
                            <br><br>
                            “Because of the national security law, I think the freedom we enjoyed in the past will be limited. You can fight for your freedom at the same time you have to face pressure from the university senior management. Although some professors or teachers will support students, they may face negative consequences. Maybe they will lose their post or they will lose research funding. I don’t know but it is quite possible.” Mr Hui said. 
                            <br><br>
                            Hong Kong ranked 87th in the world democracy index, a drop to 12 places according to the Economists Intelligence Unit’s annual democracy unit in 2020. It was downgraded from “flawed democracy” to “hybrid regime”. The report stated that “Crackdown by the authorities on dissent” was the factor of downgraded.

                            <P> Ms Wong, who asked to be known only by her surname, moved to Nottingham in the UK with her husband and 12-year-old son on their BNO passports about two months ago. A new life in the UK for Ms Wong has not been normal because all non-essential travel is banned and most gathering places are closed because of the pandemic. Her family can only go to the supermarket once a week.
                                <br><br>
                                She cannot not interact with the community in Nottingham but online group chat on Telegram and Signal have allowed her to get to know her neighbours and access up-to-date information about the UK. 
                                <br><br>
                                “ I hope that in the near future, everything is going back to normal and we can have a normal life,” Ms Wong said. 
                                <br><br>
                                There have been at least 4,248, 200 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United Kingdom, according to Public Health England. On Jan. 4, Prime Minister Boris Joshson announced the third national lockdown in England. From March 8, schools can return to face-to-face and outdoor recreation is allowed for the public.  
                                <br><br>
                                Ms Wong didn’t plan to look for a job at the moment and prefers to look after family’s members. Her husband worked at a sportswear manufacturer for a year. Her son who studies at King’s Hospital school in Iceland will return to school in March after the government easing the restrictions. 
                                <br><br>
                                Unlike Hong Kong, the weather in Nottingham has been one of the challenges for Ms Wong’s family. She said right now it is not that freezing compared to when they first arrived in mid January and they are now able to adapt to the low temperatures atmosphere. 
                                <br><br>
                                She said that transportation is not convenient compared to Hong Kong where she can easily use public transport to go to different places. In Hong Kong, shopping malls are located near her house and she can easily go shopping whenever she needs to, but in the UK, it is difficult if people do not have a car. 
                                <br><br>
                                Hong Kong has one of the highest public transport usership in the world. Its public transport was ranked fourth for its convenience and rank the top for its safety in the world according to consultancy firm McKinsey & Company. 
                                <br><br>
                                Ms Wong hasn’t encountered any difficulties related to culture difference or language barriers. She said people seem to be friendly and she hopes that such relationships will last in the future. 
                                <br><br>
                                Before Hong Kong’s return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, an estimated 250,000 to 1 million Hong Konger left the city between 1988 and 1994.
                                <br><br>
                                “This emigration would have a negative impact on the economy because those who leave the city will take their property, investment and assets. It would  have an impact on Hong Kong society,” said Prof. Yuen. 
                                She said that human resources are very precious for the development of Hong Kong. The emigration will have some substantial impact on social development, since they are professionals, middle class and they have ability and capability to contribute to society. So this obviously will have a substantial impact on social development.
