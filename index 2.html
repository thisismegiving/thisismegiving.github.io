                    <p>Mr. Wong hopes to resettle in the United Kingdom by the end of this year, leaving behind his parents and younger sister. He is worried that people in Hong Kong will lose the freedom of speech and access to fair trials. 
                        He has seen a photo of Jimmy Lai in handcuffs and chains. Lai is the proprietor of the <i>Apple Daily</i> newspaper and is one of <a href="https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2021/02/20210202/20210202_182544_078.html">nearly 100 people</a> arrested for possible violation of the national security law.

                    <p>The national security law was gazetted on June 30, 2020 and took immediate effect. It is supposed to “prevent, suppress and impose punishment for the offences of secession, subversion, organisation and perpetration of terrorist activities''. 
                        Those who “collude with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security” risk being arrested. The maximum penalty is life in prison.</p>

                    <p>“Even organising election activities within the pro-democracy camp may be a violation. There is not much we can do now in Hong Kong, so moving to another country would be a possible way for us to continue to voice our opinion toward human rights and justice in Hong Kong,” Mr Wong said. </p>

                    <div>
                    <p>In 2019, Mr Wong joined a peaceful anti-government protest. He also helped organise the district council election. He has never been a high profile person. Back then he wasn’t scared of being targeted. Since then, things have changed. Chanting the slogans of the 2019 movement may be deemed seditious. He’s read about how 12 young people who tried to leave for Taiwan ended up being caught by mainland authorities. They were jailed for a few months and returned to Hong Kong to face further charges. Mr Wong is frightened.</p>

                        <p>“We understand that moving from Hong Kong to the UK is a big decision, and some BNO holders and their families may not want to leave their home in Hong Kong. But after the imposition of the National Security Law in 2020, the sad reality is that basic rights and freedoms are no longer guaranteed and respected in Hong Kong. The BNO provides an option of moving  to the UK where individuals’ rights and freedoms can be respected,” Mr Williams said.</p>

                        <p>Mr Williams added  that the UK government is working with civil society groups and others to support the effective integration of BNO passport  holders arriving in the UK. For example, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local government has announced the Hong Kong BNO Integration Programme which dedicates over £43 million (HKD 463 million) to help BNO families and individuals who choose to settle in the UK to access housing, work and educational support. Twelve virtual Welcome Hubs were set up across the UK under the programme to tackle hate crime. An additional £300,000 (HKD 3.23 million) will be available to address BNO related hate crime in 2021/22, should it arise.</p>

                    <P>Hong Kong marked the city’s first “National Security Education Day” on April 15, which aims to raise Hong Kong residents’ awareness of  national security, create a positive atmosphere of national security, deepen understanding of the National Constitution, the Basic Law and foster national identity.</P>

                    <P>On the day, school pupils were given a chance to hold rocket launchers and other weapons, and in Tuen Mun, children watched goose-stepping parades and were taught how to hold rifles used for drills at the Immigration Department’s training Institute.</P>

                    <P>On April 22, the Education Bureau also issued a <a href="https://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/curriculum-development/renewal/CM/EDBC21004E.pdf">new guideline</a> for secondary school students to learn about national security when studying subjects including accounting, chemistry and physics.</P>

                    <p>Hui Hon-wing, a lecturer at the Department of Education Policy and Leadership at the Education University of Hong Kong said such interference in school management is not anything new. The Education Bureau has the authority to intervene in school management when necessary in order to ensure that schools comply with the guidelines. 
                    <br><br>
                    “ I think we have experienced another kind of education practice in Hong Kong. In the past we enjoyed some sort of autonomy. For example, in liberal studies classes, teachers could discuss any topics and teach the students to have their own judgement followed with different kinds of evidence. Now under the national security law and basic law education, teachers have to follow strict instructions from the Education Bureau,”  Mr Hui said.</p>
                </div>
             
                
                <p>“ I think the Education Bureau will give some materials to the schools and the officials will need the school to give them reports or responses whether they use materials provided by them.” he added.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
            <p>An associate professor at the Department of Educational Administration and Policy, Celeste Yuen Yuet-mui, from Chinese University of Hong Kong said in principle, all schools should be in line with the government guidelines. Schools receiving government subsidies have an obligation to follow the rules and regulations. </p>  
            </div>
                        
            <div>
            <p>“The point is the details of the national security law. Since this is only the initial stage, a lot of details are not yet clear. This creates a lot of  fear and the uncertainties because people do not know to what extent it will allow them to do their school based management.” Prof Yuen said.</p> 
            </div>
            <div>
            <p>“It is too early to know the impact on education as such. We have to wait and see to what extent the practical implementation of the law has on the school curriculum,” said prof. Yuen.</p>

            <div>
            <p>Hong Kong has been governed by a school based management approach. Schools have their autonomy to create their own culture and structure to some extent. But now it seems that under the national security law, there are new sets of regulations, and a new set of expectations, she added.</p>
            </div>
                        
            <div>
            <p>“I think there are some additional requirements for the school managers and leaders to follow.  Now they have a set of national security laws, to some extent the existing school managers, they have to be trained, they have to put into some kind of refreshment course so that they know how they should govern, manage and lead school according to the expectation of Hong Kong. I think that the Education Bureau is trying out things, they can not tell you clearly what you can do or what you can’t do,” Prof. Yuen said.</p>

                    <P>While some people plan to leave, there are those who want to return to their homes in Hong Kong. Angus Liu has been teaching mathematics at United World College - Robert Bosch College in Germany since 2015. He believes that being creative in teaching under the restriction would protect teachers from being grounded by the law.</p> 
                    </div>

                    <div>   
                    <p>“In the classroom, it might depend on the culture of the school on how much we could push or  say things without actually saying it. Maybe we have to invent creative codes to communicate things so that people understand what we’re coming from, also that will give us the protection that we need,” Mr Liu said.</p> 
                    </div> 
                    <div>   
                    <p>In 2009, Mr Liu left Hong Kong for education and completed his undergraduate degree in London. His parents now live in London. But he is planning to come back because he considers Hong Kong his home.</p>

                        <p>“ I am excited to contribute back to the local education system where I grew up. I thought that would be a good reason to go back,” Mr Liu said. “I think it’s time to go back and find out what home is like and to really get a sense of what it really means to be somebody who comes from the city, ” he added.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>“The new law endangers our professions because if you have negative comments on the ruling party especially communist party, they will say you have the intention to overthrow the country because “Love the country” and “Love the party” is the same thing. So it is very dangerous in Hong Kong especially for the teachers. I don’t think they will have many choices when the Education Bureau issues some instructions or even some teaching materials to teachers in Hong Kong.” Mr Hui said.</P>

This includes giving speeches, broadcasting, screening or playing recording, email and leaflets. Those found guilty can  face up to three  years in jail.

The emigration will have some substantial impact on social development, since they are professionals, middle class and they have ability and capability to contribute to society. So this obviously will have a substantial impact on social development.</P>
