                    <P>While some people plan to leave, there are those who want to return to their homes in Hong Kong. Angus Liu has been teaching mathematics at United World College - Robert Bosch College in Germany since 2015. He believes that being creative in teaching under the restriction would protect teachers from being grounded by the law.</p> 
                    </div>

                    <div>   
                    <p>“In the classroom, it might depend on the culture of the school on how much we could push or  say things without actually saying it. Maybe we have to invent creative codes to communicate things so that people understand what we’re coming from, also that will give us the protection that we need,” Mr Liu said.</p> 
                    </div> 
                    <div>   
                    <p>In 2009, Mr Liu left Hong Kong for education and completed his undergraduate degree in London. His parents now live in London. But he is planning to come back because he considers Hong Kong his home.</p>
                    </div>  
                    
                    <div>
                        <p>“ I am excited to contribute back to the local education system where I grew up. I thought that would be a good reason to go back,” Mr Liu said. “I think it’s time to go back and find out what home is like and to really get a sense of what it really means to be somebody who comes from the city, ” he added.</p>

                    <p>But Mr Hui thinks that within this restriction, under the national security law teachers won’t have choices.</p> 
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>“The new law endangers our professions because if you have negative comments on the ruling party especially communist party, they will say you have the intention to overthrow the country because “Love the country” and “Love the party” is the same thing. So it is very dangerous in Hong Kong especially for the teachers. I don’t think they will have many choices when the Education Bureau issues some instructions or even some teaching materials to teachers in Hong Kong.” Mr Hui said.</P>

This indicates that the number of people emigrating is higher than the number of immigrating. There is no official statistic on how many people are leaving the city.</p>

Canada’s immigration authorities said visa applications from Hongkongers jumped more than 10% last year to 8,640. More than 2,500 Hong Kong passport holders in Australia have had their visa extended after Canberra unveiled new rules providing a path to Australian citizenship for people from Hong Kong in July.</P>

They were barred from running in September’s LegCo election, which has been postponed for a year. Chief Executive Carrie Lam cited the public health risk as the reason.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>“We might have to be careful where and how loud we talk and what kind of setting. I guess you probably have to be more careful and know your rights and know your law a bit more. Maybe you will have more hidden conversations about politics where it is unlike before,” said Mr Liu.</p>

                        <div><p>He added that he loves teaching and he would find a way to express his opinions in a way that won’t lead him to trouble by getting caught. But if there is something that he could not avoid and that will get him into trouble, he won’t be scared and face the consequences.</p></div>   
                            
                        <div><p>“In a home, there could be things that you could do when you are not bound by what you have to do as obligations in the classroom, there are things that we could be creative and think about where I think this is the way I want to raise my children even in terrible times. We have to teach what we believe is right and wrong.” said Mr Liu. </p></div>
                        <div><p>He also said that he can sing the national anthem, but not sing it in the admiration of communist rule. He will sing it in a respect for the work that the people have been trying to build in China and those who are trying to reform China.

                        <p>The anti-extriditional bill protest in 2019 has affected Ms Cheung’s teaching approach and enabled her to reflect on how to teach the students when the students raised questions about the movement and who is right and wrong.</p>

                        <p>“Because of the national security law, I think the freedom will be limited. You can fight for your freedom at the same time you have to face pressure from the university senior management. Although some professors or teachers will support students, they may face negative consequences. Maybe they will lose their post or they will lose research funding. I don’t know but it is quite possible.” Mr Hui said.</p>

                            <p>In April, 2021, the Hong Kong government  proposed the new legislation for electoral change which highlighted the new criminal offence related to publicly urging voters to boycott polls or calling for blank and invalid ballots. This includes giving speeches, broadcasting, screening or playing recording, email and leaflets. Those found guilty can  face up to three  years in jail. The move came after Beijing-decree overhaul of the city electoral system.</p>

                            <p>Following the proposal, the legislation, the Improving Electoral System (Consolidated Amendments) was gazetted on April 13, 2021. The bill comprises six key areas of amendments including the introduction of an oath-taking requirement, method for selecting the Chief Executive, and updating composition and formation of LegCo. The eligibility of becoming candidates in the chief executive election, Election Committee Subsector elections and LegCo elections was updated, as well as the establishing Candidate Eligibility Review Committee.</p>

                            <P> Ms Wong, who asked to be known only by her surname, moved to Nottingham in the UK with her husband and 12-year-old son on their BNO passports about four months ago. She didn’t want her son to live in a society where freedom of press is restricted because this will affect his growth and mental health. </p>
