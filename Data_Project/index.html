MSAB is a phone-hacking device equivalent to the Israeli company-owned Cellebrite. 
                            This software could break mobile phone encryption and extract calls, contact, GPS, and messages sent and received via SMS, WhatsApp, Signal, and other apps. MSAB can also extract passwords and login

                            Travelers in Myanmar were asked to show their smartphones at the police checkpoint.

She doesn’t know why they are checking her phone or what information they are looking at. The checking process took around 10 minutes.

                            Surveillance systems are used in many countries, especially the global north, in order to prevent crimes and aim for a safe city. The <a href="https://www.tooltester.com/en/blog/the-worlds-most-surveilled-countries/#:~:text=Taking%20number%20one%20place%20for,impossible%20to%20go%20unnoticed%20here.">United Kingdom </a>is one of the countries that deployed the highest number of CCTV to keep a close eye on their citizens. However, Myanmar is an authoritarian state and there is no data protection for its citizens. Instead, these data collections are used to target activists and human rights defenders.

            <p class="text-white-50">
                The digital repression also began right after the military coup. The military-run state Administration Council ordered the two telecom companies, the Norwegian firm Telenor and Qatar-based Ooredoo, to hand over all their customer data to the junta, with the aim of bringing telecommunications under its control. 
                <br><br>
                The new internet law required telecom service providers Ooredoo and Telenor to reveal user personal information, such as their address, phone number, national identification number, and activity histories, to military authorities.  
                <br><br>
                This has led Telenor to withdraw from Myanmar, stating the junta’s new regulations breached European law, and sell its operations to the Lebanese M1 Group, which later sold its shares to the military-linked firm Shwe Byain Phyu, 
                according to <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2022/10/myanmar-is-the-leading-edge-of-digital-authoritarianism-in-southeast-asia/">The Diplomat.</a> 
                <br><br>
                On July 8, 2021, Telenor announced the sale of its entire operation in the country to M1 Group, a Lebanese-based investment firm, for $105 million. In March 2022, the Myanmar Investment Commission gave final approval to the sale of its operation in a <a href="https://www.telenor.com/media/newsroom/press-releases/sale-of-telenor-myanmar-approved-by-myanmar-authorities/">press release.</a> This will allow the junta to access a call data record of 18 million Myanmar subscribers consisting of the time, date of the call, 
                the phone numbers of the parties, the call duration, and the place of the call according to <a href="https://www.myanmar-now.org/en/news/telenor-will-transfer-call-data-records-for-18m-subscribers-to-junta-linked-company">Myanmar Now.</a>

                This has raised concerns among politicians, activists, and dissents in fear that the junta will get its hands on data and use it to make the arrest. <a href="https://freeexpressionmyanmar.org/experts-tell-telenor-to-stop-the-sale/#prime">Forty-five organizations</a> worldwide experts in responsible telecom operations have written to the chair of the board of Telenor Group, Gunn Wærsted, urging her to stop their rash sale to the controversial company M1 Group.

                “I felt insecure because telecommunication companies are now under military control. This is not only a concern about privacy infringement but also a threat to the democracy movement,” an activist, who refers to disclosing her name due to security concerns. 
                <br><br>
                “I am sure that the junta is using this digital surveillance and tracking data software to target democracy activists and human rights defenders because they know that if they secure all telecommunication companies, they will be able to control all communications and people movements. This will lead to more arbitrary arrests of activists and human rights defenders who protest the junta's illegitimate actions,” she added. 
                <br><br>
                There are <a href="https://www.charltonsmyanmar.com/myanmar-economy/telecommunications-in-myanmar/">four main telecommunication companies</a> in Myanmar – Myanmar Posts and Telecommunication (MPT), a state-own enterprise under the supervision of the Ministry of Transport and communication.

                The junta carried out internet restrictions and frequent internet shutdowns as a tool to limit free expression and conceal human rights abuses in the country. A press release released by <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/06/myanmar-un-experts-condemn-militarys-digital-dictatorship">United Nations</a> on June 7, 2022, stated that 54 of Myanmar's 330 townships are affected by the internet shutdown and internet speed throttling. A report published by the <a href="https://freeexpressionmyanmar.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/freedom-of-the-net-2022.pdf?utm_source=Free+Expression+Myanmar+%28FEM%29&utm_campaign=1862591e50-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_10_17_05_40&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_60a38670fb-1862591e50-440318317%27">Freedom House</a>

                There is a coincidence that when human rights violations are committed by the military junta, the internet will be shut down in that area. On October 24, 2022, when the military junta airstrike on a concert commemorating the 62nd anniversary of the founding of the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) in Hpakant, Myanmar, that have killed 80 people and injured hundreds, the public was left isolated, unable to contact friends and family to seek help and urgent medical attention.

                “There have always been concerns about digital security because these telecommunications companies were under military control. The military can order these companies to shut the internet or telecommunication lines down in areas where they conduct so-called military operations,” said Mr. Seng.

                Despite the torture, arbitrary arrests, killings, and internet restrictions, the public continues their revolution on online platforms by documenting human rights violations committed by the military’s security forces. Activists and protesters have utilized social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram as tools for collaboration and report of human rights violations.
