                            In 2021, the Myanmar military <a href https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnQPtQNiJGg>stages a coup</a> to overthrow a democratically elected government led by <a href https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11685977>Aung San Suu Kyi,</a> claiming that there is widespread fraud and demanding an investigation. However, there is no evidence to support the claim, according to the election commission. The coup has triggered a nationwide social movement in Myanmar 
                            and has caused more than a thousand deaths and arrests, according to the <a href https://aappb.org>Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.</a>
                            <br><br>
                            In this social movement, protesters adopt and adapt a range of internet memes, slogans, and symbols to make themselves heard and mobilise within the country and across the regions. 
                            Memes and symbols were copied, transformed, and combined in diverse contexts. As <a href https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc&t=1002s>Ferguson (2016)</a> noted, content curation can be done through copying, transforming, and combining without expensive tools, 
                            distributors, or skills in this remix culture. With a user-friendly application, individuals are able to download and re-edit content, turning this remixing strategy into an extremely popular practise <a href https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.uow.idm.oclc.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6658681.pdf&bkn=6658626&pdfType=chapter&tag=1>(Shifman, 2014).</a> 
                            This remix culture was adopted in both online and offline movements.

                            Famous internet memes, such as Pepe the Frog, adopted in 2016 as a symbol of the US far right, and Doge and Cheems, used by Hong Kong pro-democracy activists, 
                            were adopted in this <a href https://twitter.com/nikitakaulitz/status/1358747517618434048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1358747517618434048%7Ctwgr%5E66b0ff0bde4a9292f5b25df46be130569f44c4a3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2021%2Ffeb%2F08%2Fthree-finger-salute-hunger-games-symbol-adopted-by-myanmars-protesters>Myanmar anti-coup movement.</a> Young activists from Myanmar copy and transform these memes into a version that suits their political context 
                            in the anti-coup protest. Pepe the frog meme was also edited in a video version, in a moment when an aerobic teacher captures the military trucks entering Naypyidaw, 
                            the capital city of Myanmar, to seize power in her workout video.

                            In addition to the adoption of internet memes, one of the popular symbols adopted in the anti-coup protest is the use of the three-finger salute, 
                            originally from the Hollywood film <a href https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V6d3f8W-oc>"The Hunger Game".</a> In this movie, the three-finger salute represents solidarity in a dystopian world where rebels 
                            fought for freedom against an all-powerful tyrant <a href https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/08/three-finger-salute-hunger-games-symbol-adopted-by-myanmars-protesters>(The Guardian, 2021).</a> This gesture was used by activists to show their defiance of the military junta 
                            and their support for human rights, freedom, and democracy in Myanmar. <a href https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.uow.idm.oclc.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6658681.pdf&bkn=6658626&pdfType=chapter&tag=1>Shifman (2014)</a> describes this imitation as mimicry. It involves the practise of 
                            redoing or re-creating specific texts by other people or by other means. The three-finger salute gesture was 
                            sometimes combined with images and transformed into gif and video formats by individuals according to their preferences.

                            These digitised memes and symbols diffuse online and circulate between different platforms, given the availability of Web 2.0. 
                            Digital platforms such as YouTube and social media sites allow the transformation of these memes, which pass a certain view threshold and inspire a stream of emulations. 
                            Facebook was one of the most popular sites for meme and symbol circulation in Myanmar. For example, a remix of the three-figure salute gesture with a peacock, which is a logo of the National Democratic Party (NLD), was widely spread on Facebook. The built-in sharing feature of Facebook offered activists the ability 
                            to circulate particular memes, images, and videos on the internet to call for collaboration, solidarity, and action.
                            <br><br>
                            These memes and symbols are not only circulated online, but they are also applied offline. 
                            During the rally, protesters raise three fingers and carry placards with these memes on the street. 
                            Such events and actions are digitised, shared again online, and circulated on different platforms. 
                            Memes may spread on a micro basis, but their impact is on the macro level because they shape the mindset, forms of behaviour, and actions of social groups (Shifman, 2014). 
                            User-generated memes are spread by individuals through social networks and can scale up to mass levels within hours.
                            <br><br>
                            To conclude, digital culture such as propagation from individuals to society, reproduction through copying and imitation, 
                            and diffusion via competition (Shifman, 2014) enable the spread of memes and symbols to become desired and highly valued. 
                            Symbols and memes are reproduced in a variety of formats and diffused on digital platforms globally. It can be copied from another context and adapted to fit the local context. 
                            It also travels from online to offline and from offline to digital platforms.

                        <p class="text-black-50">
                            On March 8, 2021, International Women’s Day, women protesters call for a nationwide <a href https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxej5/sarong-revolution-women-smash-gender-taboos-to-fight-myanmar-junta>"Women’s Sarong Revolution"</a> to challenge a deeply rooted gender norm in Myanmar. 
                            Many people in Myanmar held the misogynistic belief that women are impure during menstruation and that passing under women's clothing that has touched their private 
                            parts will sap men’s innate masculine power and destroy their luck <a href https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxej5/sarong-revolution-women-smash-gender-taboos-to-fight-myanmar-junta>(Khin Khin Mra, 2021).</a> 
                            Thus, women’s sarongs are required to hang lower than men’s clothing, and men tend to avoid walking under them.
                        <br><br>
                        To challenge this misogynistic belief and to fight the military junta, which staged a coup in February 2021, colourful sarongs were attached to ropes hung across the road, 
                        and sometimes red painted sanitary pads were hung along with them during the protest. Some women's groups turned women’s sarongs into flags with the slogan <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxej5/sarong-revolution-women-smash-gender-taboos-to-fight-myanmar-junta">"our sarong, our flag, our victory".</a>
                        This creative approach has been effective because many members of the security forces hold misogynistic beliefs and are reluctant to pass under hanging sarongs <a href https://www.frontiermyanmar.net/en/with-htamein-barricades-and-flags-protesters-launch-a-revolution-within-a-revolution/>(Frontier Myanmar, 2021).</a>

                        <p class="text-black-50">
                        On social media, there are widespread hashtags like <a href https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/htameincampaign>#HtamenCampaign</a>(Burmese language). 
                        Many young women and men have joined this campaign by posting a selfie of themselves wrapping women’s sarongs around their heads and bodies and holding sarong flags on social media. 
                        This collective action can be defined as a smart mob, which refers to a group of people who could come together and cooperate in ways never possible before because they carried devices that had both 
                        communication and computing abilities <a href https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/westminster/reader.action?docID=5491891&ppg=4>(Dey and Karatzogianni, 2018)</a>. The affordable <a href https://partnersasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017_Mobilizing-Myanmar_BMGF-16MB.pdf>mobile data and inexpensive Android smart phone</a> imported from China into the Burmese community in the past few years 
                        have offered individuals from different rural regions a low-cost way to participate in the campaign compared to the more conventional forms of participation. With technologies and the internet, collectives have been established, 
                        and women’s voices have become much more assertive and powerful <a href https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/westminster/reader.action?docID=5491891&ppg=4>(Dey and Karatzogianni, 2018).</a> 
                        <br><br>
                        A digital device like a smart phone enables individuals to digitise images, videos, and information from the ground and tell a version of their stories without the 
                        reliability of mainstream media. The network sites, such as Facebook, provide these women protesters with an alternative platform to tell their stories to the rest of the world. 
                        Individuals use their smartphones to record images of the security forces reluctant to pass under women’s sarongs and using sticks to remove those sarongs while confronting protesters. 
                        These recorded images and videos were later shared on different digital platforms across the country and regions. The story was later covered by both local mainstream media and international news outlets. 
                        The digital platforms diminish the reliance upon traditional 
                        media and provide opportunities for self-representation and self-organisation through direct mobilisation without structure or action <a href >(Dumitrica and Felt, 2020).</a>

                        To successfully mobilise the Sarong revolution offline, these women's groups are utilising mobile instant messaging apps for information sharing among each other. Digital technologies such as 
                        a mobile phone have the capacity to instantly connect a person to the hundred million others who possess similar devices that scatter in the community and link to countless internet servers. 
                        This can be conceptualised as a ‘network society’ as put forward by Manuel Castells (cited in Dey and Karatzogianni, 2018). 
                        Network society refers to a society whose social structure is made of networks powered by microelectronics-based information and communication technologies (Dey and Karatzogianni, 2018). 
                        It lacks the presence of centres and is only held together by an interconnection of nodes.
                        <br><br>
                        To sum up, digital media—mobile phones and the internet played an important role in the social movement of 
                        women's groups in Myanmar to deconstruct patriarchy in Burmese society. Collective movement, digitising, 
                        and the network society that were processed through digital devices and the internet have enabled the campaign to be successful. 
                        Women protesters are able to tell their stories in their own version without relying on mainstream media.

                        <p class="text-white-50">
                        The arrival of digital technologies has been an effective medium of communication for many social movements around the globe. Many scholars have hailed these digital devices 
                        and the network platforms for their roles in various social movements. However, there has been a rise in digital repression through the deployment of new technologies by the 
                        government to counter dissent, maintain political control, and ensure the regime’s survival <a href https://academic-oup-com.uow.idm.oclc.org/book/39418>(Feldstein, 2021).</a>
                        <br><br>
                        In 2016, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) launched a project called Project Raven. As part of this project, the UAE authority contracted a former National Security Agency operative 
                        to hack into the smartphones of targeted individuals such as human rights activists, journalists, and political rivals in order to access phone numbers, emails, passwords, and even 
                        track the location of the phones’ users <a href https://academic-oup-com.uow.idm.oclc.org/book/39418>(Feldstein, 2021).</a> <a href https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-raven/>Reuters’s investigative</a> report revealed that the Raven operation would monitor social media and target people who security 
                        forces felt had insulted the government.
                        <br><br>
                        According to Reuters, prominent Emirati activist Ahmed Mansoor became a particular focus of the programme due to his public criticism of 
                        the UAE’s government's involvement in the Yemen conflict and the persecution of the regime’s opponents. The Raven operator has hacked into 
                        his computer and obtained screenshots of emails in which he discussed an upcoming demonstration in front of the UAE’s Federal Supreme Court 
                        with family members of imprisoned dissidents. In 2017, Mansoor was convicted in a secret trial for damaging the country’s unity and sentenced 
                        to 10 years in jail. After his arrest, his wife was targeted by the Project Raven operators, who used a new surveillance tool known as <a href https://academic-oup-com.uow.idm.oclc.org/book/39418/chapter/339131856>"Karma"</a> 
                        to obtain emails, locations, text messages, and photographs from iPhones simply by uploading lists of numbers into a preconfigured system. 
                        This new software did not require a target to click on a link sent to an iPhone; it is a tool that could remotely grant access to iPhones 
                        by simply uploading phone numbers or email accounts into an automated targeting system <a href https://www.lawfareblog.com/prosecuting-project-raven-new-frontier-export-control-enforcement>(Van Grack and Folio, 2021).</a> 
                        <br><br>
                        The case of Ahmed Mansoor has demonstrated how the UAE’s authority employed commercial spyware to surveil 
                        its citizens or anyone who seemed a threat to the state. This act can be identified as targeted surveillance. 
                        According to <a href https://academic-oup-com.uow.idm.oclc.org/book/39418/chapter/339131856>Feldstein,</a> targeted surveillance is "intrusion operations that manipulate software, data, computer systems, 
                        or networks in order to gain unauthorised access to user information and devices" <a href https://academic-oup-com.uow.idm.oclc.org/book/39418/chapter/339131856>(Feldstein, 2021, p. 5).</a> 
                        The state often justified its surveillance operations for national security and public order reasons. 
                        But the <a href https://citizenlab.ca/about/>Citizen Lab,</a> an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, 
                        University of Toronto, noted that the real motivation for their deployment is to track and target political opponents. 
                        This abusive and intrusive hacking undermines and puts greater pressure on an individual’s right to privacy. 
                        <br><br>
                        The digital space also undermines human rights because of the consequences a targeted individual would face, such as arrests, physical attacks, 
                        legal charges, prolonged detention, and directed violence. These reprisals undermine the right to freedom of expression and the development of vibrant, 
                        pluralistic democracies. Mansoor was jailed for 10 years and held in solitary confinement, with his health declining because of his critique of the government, 
                        according to a Reuters report. He was being punished for exercising his freedom of speech online and offline, to which all citizens are entitled. As a result of surveillance, 
                        individuals will adopt self-censorship and avoid sharing opinions that may differ from the authority out of fear of reprisal. Individuals tend to alter their behaviour to what 
                        they believe is expected so as not to draw attention to themselves when they are aware that they are being watched.
                        <br><br>
                        In summary, surveillance seemed effective in combating terrorism and crime, but this was often used 
                        by state authorities for illegitimate reasons such as targeting human rights activists, journalists, and dissidents. 
                        While the authority claims surveillance is for national security and public order, it raises questions about privacy and freedom of expression. 
                        It prevents private social and political groups from expressing themselves <a href https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/12/13/surveillance-is-a-fact-of-life-so-make-privacy-a-human-right>(The Economist).</a>
