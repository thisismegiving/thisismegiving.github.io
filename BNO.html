                    <p>The BNO passport is a travel document that does not carry citizenship rights, but holders are entitled to some consular assistance outside Hong Kong and China. It was created for people from Hong Kong so that they could retain British nationality and a connection to the UK after the handover to China in 1997 in line with the Sino-British Joint Declaration.</p>

                        <p>Jonathan Williams, Head of political and communications from the British Consulate-General Hong Kong said it is uncertain how many BNO holders will  move to the UK using the new visa route, given the impact of COVID-19. But the estimate is  between 123,000 and 153,700 visa applications in the first year and between 258,000 and 322,400 over the following five years.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>“We understand that moving from Hong Kong to the UK is a big decision, and some BNO holders and their families may not want to leave their home in Hong Kong. But after the imposition of the National Security Law in 2020, the sad reality is that basic rights and freedoms are no longer guaranteed and respected in Hong Kong. The BNO provides an option of moving  to the UK where individuals’ rights and freedoms can be respected,” Mr Williams said.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>Mr Williams added  that the UK government is working with civil society groups and others to support the effective integration of BNO passport  holders arriving in the UK. For example, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local government has announced the Hong Kong BNO Integration Programme which dedicates over £43 million (HKD 463 million) to help BNO families and individuals who choose to settle in the UK to access housing, work and educational support. Twelve virtual Welcome Hubs were set up across the UK under the programme to tackle hate crime. An additional £300,000 (HKD 3.23 million) will be available to address BNO related hate crime in 2021/22, should it arise.</p>

There are no plans to stop issuing British passports to British Nationals Overseas. The UK Government – and countless countries around the world – continue to recognise valid BNO passports.”</p>

                    <p>Mr Wong thinks that it is meaningless to be a Hongkonger because his vote would not be counted toward a candidate he voted for and at the end the central government would appoint the chief executive of Hong Kong. </p>

                    <p>“ I totally lost my confidence in the Hong Kong judiciary and they won’t treat me fairly. I believe that British nationality will give me better protection because of my political background and the work I do.” Mr Wong said.</p>

                    <p>A survey by the <a href="https://www.hkupop.hku.hk/english/release/release1594.html"> University of Hong Kong</a> in 2019 found that 84.6% of 692 respondents identify themself as “Hongkonger” while 55.2% of respondents would indicate their identity as "Chinese". Among  younger respondents, aged 18-29, more than 90% also did not feel proud of  becoming a national citizen of China and more than 71% gave negative appraisal toward the central government policy on Hong Kong.</p>

                    <div>
                    <p>Professor from the Department of Public Policy at City University of Hong Kong, who asked to remain anonymous, said young people have a strong sense of  identity as  Hongkongers because they were born and raised in the city and it is natural that they would have a strong feeling of belonging to Hong Kong.</p>

                    <p>A policy paper by the <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/cshk/files/PolicyPapers/CSHK%20Policy%20Paper%204-HK%20Identity-Eng.pdf">Research Center for Sustainable Hong Kong</a> in 2018 found that trust in the central government was a highly significant factor to explain national identity strength.</p>
                    </div>  
                    
                    <div>
                    <p>The paper concluded  that “Chinese and Hong Kong identities should be understood and measured as two related, but clearly distinct attitudes. The identity strength of “Hongkonger” has essentially remained stable and unpolitical. It is the sense of belonging to China that has become weaker and increasingly partisan.”</p>

                    <p> Ms Cheung loves Chinese culture but would consider herself as a Chinese person from Hong Kong, it is because she doesn’t want to have any linkage with the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

                    <p>“I came from Hong Kong and I am a Hongkonger, that’s a choice I made. I am ethnically from the Han Chinese race. That's something that I can’t change. It’s not a problem for me to say that I am Chinese.  It’s my roots, my heritage and it’s where I come  from. I don’t deny it. But predominantly I am from Hong Kong because it is so different from mainland China, I think we have to assert that difference ”Ms Cheung said.</p>
